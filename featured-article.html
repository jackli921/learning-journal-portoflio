            <h2 article-title>Journey: Becoming a self-taught Web Developer</h2>
            <p class="article-info">Oct 1, 2022</p>
            <p class="featured-text">After many failed sporadic attempts to learn programming after high school, I was discouraged and convinced
                myself that I did not have the intellect to be a decent programmer. But as paradoxical as this may sound, deep down, 
                I also refused to believe in it.</p>
                
            <p class="featured-text">Not only was I comparing myself with my peersm but I was judging my frustrations with the financial and academic success of my
                peers. Detrimental. What was worse, however, was being ignorant about the state I was putting myself into. </p>
            <img src="images/blog-image-hero.png" alt="">

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="featured-text">Curiosity in understanding and applying logic</li>
                <li class="featured-text">A comprehensive curriculum led by amazing teachers</li>
                <li class="featured-text">A supportive community backed by peers and great mentors</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p class="featured-text">Word of mouth from a friend who had used Scrimba to learn React.</p> 
            <p class="featured-text">After trying out Scrimba's free HTML&CSS course, I was hooked.
            Scrimba made learning interactive, engaging, and fun. </p>
           
            <p class="featured-text">I understand, applied, and absorbed more concepts through their screencasts than any other method
            I had tried before. It was effective, enjoyable, and sustainble. So, after a week, I started the Front End Developer Career Path.
